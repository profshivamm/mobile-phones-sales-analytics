2. Provide comprehensive visibility into sales performance.
3. Support decision-making by breaking down data by time, geography, brand, and payment methods.
4. Highlight opportunities for improvement using key metrics like ratings, transactions, and average price.

Action:

2. Built detailed analytics views for:
    a.  Yearly, Quarterly, and Monthly Sales Trends, with comparisons to previous years.
    b.  Geographical Insights via a sales map, pinpointing city-level performance.
    c.  Payment Method Analysis, showing preferences for UPI, cash, and card payments.
    d.  Integrated customer feedback metrics, such as ratings by category (Good, Average, Poor).
    e.  optimized the dashboard for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility on the go.
